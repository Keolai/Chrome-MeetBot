**How to Use**

This extension is not currently on the chrome webstore, so it must be downloaded and uploaded to chrome manually by enabling developer mode.

To use, simply click on the extension icon to open the main page, then click on the page you would like to configure. 

**Quirks to Keep in Mind**
* Use military time.
* When entering the time, **do not** add a colon between time and minutes.
* Use whole links (including the HTTPS portion!)
* When configuring a page, click the reset button before you hit save. The data will not be updated if you do not do so. 

**Features that will be added**
* Individual time/link reset buttons
* Current configuration page

**Potential Changes**
* Combine reset and save button functionality
* Recall storage items in an array
* Find a way to change persistance to false, without losing functionality
