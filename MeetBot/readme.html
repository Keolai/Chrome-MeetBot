    <P style="font-size:160%;">
Open the extension and click the day that you would like to configure. Enter in your links and times, you can either save each slot individually with the <b>save</b> button to the right of the slot, or you can save them all with the <b>save all</b> button. However, this also saves the unconfigured slots, so only do this when you want to configure the whole day.

    <p style="font-size:160%;">
Now that the day is configured, you can let the extension run. It will check the time every two minutes, so it will join your meet either <i>two</i> or <i>three</i> minutes before the start time. Make sure to leave browser open at least <i>five</i> minutes before the meet to allow it to actually join.

    <b style="font-size:230%;">Troubleshooting</b>
    <P style="font-size:160%;">
If your extension isn't joining a meet, check the configuration of that day using the <b>configuration</b> button. If that is working, go to the extension page right after the extension fails, and click the <b>background page</b> hyperlink in the extension box. Read what the console says. If there isn't any message indicating an error, or if a portion of the configuration page isn't working properly, submit a bug report on the <a style="color: #096658" href="https://github.com/Keolai/Chrome-MeetBot">GitHub page</a> or send me an email.
